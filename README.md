## Overview

This project is a front-end application designed to test my skills as a junior front end developer, to see if I am up to task for the role. I was provided a figma file to follow the design and turn the design into a functioning web application.

The tasks include:

Implementation

- Use HTML and CSS (JavaScript optional)
- Ensure responsiveness for mobile and desktop
- Basic form validation for the contact form (e.g., required fields)

Basic CSS Animations

- Add CSS animations to improve the user experience
- Hover effects for button
- Simple animation for section transitions
- Can add more animations to the elements to showcase your skills

Code Quality

- Ensure clean, well-organized code
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Comment your code where necessary

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this project utilizes mobile-first workflow and media querries for responsiveness.

## Notes

- I've made css root variables for easier changing of primary colors, semantic colors, bg colors, card colors, etc..
- I used JavaScript for the functionality of some elements, e.g. movement of cards, show more and less buttons, changing of specific elements when mobile vs desktop.
- Added comments to places where I deemed necessary for better code readability and to have the ability to jump to specific parts in the files when needing maintenance or rework.
